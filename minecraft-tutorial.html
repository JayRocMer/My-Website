        <section id="welcome">
            Welcome to Minecraft, where the world is yours to shape and explore! In this tutorial, we'll cover the
            basics
            to get you started on your journey. First things first, let's talk about gathering resources. Begin by
            punching trees to collect wood. Wood is essential for crafting tools, shelter, and more. Once you have
            some
            wood, open your crafting menu (by pressing E on PC) and craft a crafting table. Place the crafting table
            on
            the ground and use it to craft more advanced items.</section>

        <section id="shelter">
            Now that you have some basic materials, it's time to build your first shelter. Nightfall in Minecraft
            brings
            dangerous creatures like zombies and skeletons, so having a safe place to spend the night is crucial.
            Start
            by crafting some wooden planks and building a simple structure, like a small wooden hut. Make sure to
            add a
            door to keep monsters out! You can expand and improve your shelter later on, but for now, focus on
            creating
            a basic structure to keep you safe.</section>

        <section id="venture">
            With your shelter in place, it's time to explore the world around you. Venture out into the wilderness
            and
            gather resources like stone, coal, and food. Stone can be mined with a wooden pickaxe, which you can
            craft
            using sticks and wooden planks. Coal is found in the depths of caves and can be used as fuel for torches
            and
            furnaces. Don't forget to keep an eye out for animals to hunt for food, such as pigs and cows. Remember,
            Minecraft is all about creativity and exploration, so don't be afraid to experiment and see what wonders
            await you in this blocky world!</section>
