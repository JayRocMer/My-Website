The home page looks good and easy to read. the color shceme and the background both pop. The only thing that is that the nav bar items 
redirect to all new tabs. i dont know if that is on purpose or not. The other pages seem good just need to add more pictures and thing 
of that nature.

Hi Jasmin! I really like the contrast between the purple text and black/grey background and how it resembles the nether portals in Minecraft. 
The home page does a very good job of selling the website, as well as having a good amount of information “above the fold”.

However, I do think the tutorial page could be improved. when you shrink the tab it causes the text to overlap and become unreadable, and the 
background is different from the other pages on the site.
